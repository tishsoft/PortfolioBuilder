#### What is LooseLeaf?

LooseLeaf is a **project-based** professional networking platform for aspiring **newcomers** of the tech and creative industries to try out a career path, improve their knowledge and skills, build an online portfolio, and acquire relevant work experience and receive mentorship through **completing projects** for non-profits, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs.

LooseLeaf serves a two-sided market: (1) the newcomers who look for career building opportunities by volunteering their time in exchange for feedback and validation of their abilities and (2) the non-profits, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs looking for a way to de-risk and minimize cost for their operations.

#### Who uses LooseLeaf?

**Newcomers:**  

LooseLeaf help people who are in the midst of changing careers, college students who are establishing new careers, and high school students who are exploring career tracks demonstrate what they can do. These newcomers of tech and creative industries are smart, can pick things up on their own, and have the initiative and discipline to start and finish projects; however, they may lack formal education and are missing some key skills and relevant work experience to get overlooked by recruiters and employers.

Companies need smart people who are flexible, versatile, and are successful with minimal supervision. As formals degrees remain generalized and technology jobs become more specialized, companies will need more nuanced ways to determine who is the best fit. This is where LooseLeaf users gain an advantage; they have a head start in developing the most relevant skills set for an evolving job market.

**Project Creators**

Project creators are non-profits, entrapreneurs, intrapreneurs, teachers, researchers, and college professors, to name a few. Basically, anyone who is thinking about hiring a freelancer to get something done should use LooseLeaf instead. Why? LooseLeaf is totally free and there's no limit to how many people can work on your project. Instead of paying one person a lot of money to produce something that doesn't meet all you needs, you pay nothing and get to choose from a smorgasbord of project submissions.

#### What are some examples of projects?

* ✔️ A landing page for a non-profit's website
* ✔️ An original illustration for a blog
* ✔️ A single page application that demonstrates Newton's second law of motion
* ✔️ A data visualization for exploring and presenting your research data
* ✔️ A utility library for grabbing and processing data fetched from a remote API for your web app


#### How it works

**Find and work on projects**

1. The newcomers can browse open projects in the marketplace posted by non-profits, entrepreneurs, and other newcomers to work on to acquire relevant work experience, professional connections, and mentorship. There is no limit to how many people can work on each project.
2. Newcomers can browse open projects in areas of their interest and add the projects they want to work on to their todo-list and watch-list. They can document their efforts in how they are completing these projects, and receive notifications of how other people are completing their projects.
3. The project creators provide direct feedback for all those who contribute a deliverable to the projects. A history of completed projects and the feedback received is accumulated on a newcomer's profile, which provides an overview of the newcomer's abilities.

**Peer Mentorship**

Indirect Mentorship from other people also working on their career change.

1. Observe what someone else at their experience level would do to complete a project (e.g., creating a landing page for a non-profit or designing a logo for a startup founder)
2. Provide encouragement and feedback to each other during the project completion process.

LooseLeaf's peer mentorship system groups newcomers of similar skill levels, aspirations, and interest areas, and shared projects to create social networks. When newcomers browse open projects in areas of their interest, they can add the projects they would like to complete to their todo-list and watch-list. They can document their efforts in how they are completing these projects, which sends notifications to other newcomers in their network.


#### LooseLeaf's Innovation

**Provide Clarity on "Relevant" in Relevant Work Experience**

The major challenges of self-study for a career change include the lack of insight on what skills to build, what to work on to build these skills, and how the skill building activity will improve chance of employment in a chosen career track. LooseLeaf’s innovation specifically addresses these challenges by integrating data from job boards and profile of companies who are posting to these job boards into LooseLeaf’s information system to inform newcomers on how to work on each project to maximize their return-on-investment with regard to acquiring in-demand skills and relevant work experience. Preliminary research on recruiting and hiring trends revealed that companies now source prospective employees through professional networking sites like LinkedIn which utilize algorithms that scan candidates’ resumes and online profiles for knowledge and experience keywords that match a job description. These algorithms then recommend those candidates to recruiters who further assess the candidates’ viability through reviewing their portfolio and work experience for work samples and evidence of their abilities. LooseLeaf’s innovation helps career-changers laser focus their self-study effort to target the specific in-demand skills, relevant experience, and knowledge areas by completing projects, which are collected in a portfolio that impresses recruiters.

**Peer Mentorship System**

Another challenge of self-study is the ability to stay motivated and focused to effectively and efficiently filter through and utilize the massive collection of free learning resources online. LooseLeaf’s second innovation is the integration of social networking features to create a peer mentorship system, in which newcomers can (1) observe what someone else at their experience level would do to complete a project (e.g., creating a landing page for a non-profit or designing a logo for a startup founder) and (2) provide encouragement and feedback to each other during the project completion process. The peer mentorship system groups newcomers of similar skill levels, aspirations, and interest areas, and shared projects to create social networks. When newcomers browse open projects in areas of their interest, they can add the projects they would like to complete to their todo-list and watch-list. They can document their efforts in how they are completing these projects, which sends notifications to other newcomers in their network.

#### Why LooseLeaf

1. Access to work opportunities does not need to be blocked by unaffordable college education.
2. Work opportunities create learning opportunities.
3. The future of Work is peer-to-peer, distributed, and modular.

#### TL;DR

**LooseLeaf:  project-based professional networking site**

There have been efforts to disrupt the education to career pipeline, especially in the software and and creative industries. The advent of massive open online courses offered alternatives to the traditional higher education but fall short of offering the same benefits which universities and internships provide, in particular, the ability to advance through a career development process with peers, networking with professionals, alumni and recruiters, and a clear path to employment. Coding bootcamps and career accelerators address these shortcomings at a steep cost and are no better in job placement rates than college grads.

LooseLeaf is a project-based professional networking platform for aspiring newcomers of the tech and creative industries to try out a career path, improve their knowledge and skills, build an online portfolio, and acquire relevant work experience and receive mentorship through completing projects  for non-profits, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs.
