# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: October 1, 2018

This policy explains what information we collect when you use LooseLeaf’s sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content (“Services”). It also has information about how we store, use, transfer, and delete that information. Our aim is not just to comply with privacy law. It’s to earn your trust.

## Information We Collect & How We Use It

LooseLeaf doesn’t make money from ads. So we don’t collect data in order to advertise to you. The tracking we do at LooseLeaf is to make our product work as well as possible.

In order to give you the best possible experience using LooseLeaf, we collect information from your interactions with our network and content on LooseLeaf. This information includes your reaction to posts (hearts, thumb ups), comments to posts, when you join a project as a contributor or watcher, and other users you follow.

You may also choose to indicate your interests from the Settings page, which improves LooseLeaf's recommendation of projects and other users to follow for you. Your interests are not viewable from your profile page but may be used by search engines for indexing your profile page.

LooseLeaf won’t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating third-party advertising to you. We won’t sell information about you.

LooseLeaf won't share the email address that you use to sign up with LooseLeaf with anyone. The email address is used by LooseLeaf to communicate with you as detailed below in the next section.

## Email from LooseLeaf

Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t opt out of this type of “transactional” email (unless you delete your account). But, you can opt out of non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications through your account’s “Settings” page

When your interact with an email sent from LooseLeaf (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction. We won’t email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, please send it to us so we can investigate.

## Data Storage

LooseLeaf uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run LooseLeaf. We maintain two types of logs: server logs and event logs. By using LooseLeaf Services, you authorize LooseLeaf to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate.

## Tracking & Cookies

We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences (such as default language), evaluate email effectiveness and personalize content and other information.

LooseLeaf tracks when account holders last logged in. This is used to sort the list of users who are members of a community. On the community pages, users are shown in order of last logged in. When they last logged in is also viewable from the community pages.

LooseLeaf doesn’t track you across the Internet. We track only your interactions within the LooseLeaf network.

Some third-party services that we use to provide the LooseLeaf Service, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by LooseLeaf only and not the use of cookies by third parties.


## Modifying or Deleting Your Personal Information

If you have a LooseLeaf account, you can access, modify or export your personal information,

Currently, LooseLeaf does not provide the capability for you to delete your accounts on your own, but we are working on implementing this feature so you may in the future. In the interim, if you wish to delete your account, please send us an account deletion request at <a href="mailto: hello@looseleafapp.com">hello@looseleafapp.com</a>.

We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.
Business Transfers

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you in advance so you can opt out of any such new policy by deleting your account before transfer.

## Changes to this Policy

LooseLeaf may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes to it. The most current version of the policy will always be here and we will archive former versions of the policy here.

LooseLeaf collects and stores personal information about its users to customize their reading experience and enable personalized distribution of content. It shares minimal data with its service providers.

### Purposes of Processing

- Provide, test, promote, and improve the services
- Gather usage statistics of services
- Provide customized reading experience
- Publish and distribute user-generated content
- Provide access to paid content

- Fight spam, fraud, and other abuse of services

### Legal Bases

In order to provide the services, LooseLeaf collects and stores personal data about its users on the legal basis of consent given when you create an account and agree to the Privacy Policy.

LooseLeaf also pursues its legitimate interests by collecting minimal data of logged out users to provide the services, as outlined above.

Where LooseLeaf collects and stores personal data about non-users, it does so under performance of contract obligations with users who use the services to publish content on web sites hosted by LooseLeaf. In such cases, users authoring such content containing personal data of third parties are responsible for that content. LooseLeaf will consider related complaints in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation’s rights of the data subject, as well as rights of expression and access to information.

### Public Nature of Personal Data

Logged-in users may choose to interact publicly with the LooseLeaf Services in the form of reacting to a post, commenting to a post, following other user accounts, writing original posts, creating an original project, watching a project, opt-in to contribute to a project.

Where such personal data may reveal special category protected data, it is processed on the basis that it is manifestly made public by the user. Additional information on potential consequences of such processing can be found below.

### Potential Consequences of Processing

By creating an account on LooseLEaf, users may make certain personal data about themselves public and accessible to others on their profile and through network interactions. This may in some cases constitute special category protected data which is considered manifestly made public by the user.

Due to the public nature of information posted to LooseLeaf, it may be possible for third parties to derive identifying personal data from posts, whether by reading, inference, supplemental research, or automated extraction and analysis.

Users are free to use their real name and information, or a pseudonym of their choosing, for their account. Users may also choose to use the service without posting data or engaging in network interactions. However, if you do not agree with and accept the risks of such usage, you may not use the services.
