At LooseLeaf, we believe people with genuine passion for the work and the self initiative and grit to continue learning and improving upon their skills should not be precluded from careers simply because they did not go through a costly four year credentialing program. Everyone who's willing to invest time and effort in their professional development deserves free access to mentorship, peer support system, and opportunities to acquire practical work experience. We believe companies should have a better way to find these individuals, recruit them, and assess their abilities and culture fit based on more granular data of their track record.
