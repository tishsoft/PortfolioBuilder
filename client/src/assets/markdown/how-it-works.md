# What is LooseLeaf

LooseLeaf is a crowdsourcing platform for getting your projects done by others for little to no cost. Those who work on a project for you are career changers and college students who need a free and non-demanding method to acquire relevant work experience, build a portfolio of sample work, receive mentorship and networking opportunities with you and other collaborators of your project.

As an intersection of freelancing, project collaboration, and candidate sourcing platform, LooseLeaf is designed to help people with career aspirations in the technical and creative industries realize their full potential by building up an impressive sample of work to demonstrate their skills, knowledge, work ethic, and effectiveness in working with others.

## Fixing the Education-to-Work Pipeline

We believe that the current education-to-work pipeline is broken. A four-year college degree in the U.S costs up to $200,000 and offers no guarantee of a fulfilling career in the area of study. Employers are more demanding than ever (even for entry level positions) in job applicants having relevant work experience and industry-specific skills, many of which are not taught in an undergraduate university curriculum. Coding bootcamps and other career accelerators have popped up in recent years, but they charge participants an exuberant amount of money for no real guarantee of job placement.

The world needs an integrated work and learning solution in which the need to solve real world problems drives learning and skill-building.

## Rethinking Recruiting and Freelancing

Many complex and costly platforms have emerged in recent years to help companies to find prospective employees, sort and filter a large pool of applicants, and track and automate some of the processes for job applicants to go through each stage of the hiring process. These platforms are collectively known as Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) and Candidate Relationship Management (CRM) system. Among the well known ATS and CRM systems include LinkedIn, Hired, Lever, Bamboo, AngelList are well known.

Despite these innovations, many employers still have difficulty finding the right people for their team. We believe the reasons are as follows:

1. Companies and recruiters source perspective employees via LinkedIn, Google and other social and career platforms but few of these prospective employees are currently seeking a job.
2. It is infeasible to implement an interview process that screens a candidate based on his/her ability to add to the teamâ€™s overall knowledge profile and work well with the existing members of the team. For example, there are alternatives to the algorithm interview to assess someone's effectiveness as a new developer for your team, which includes peer coding or "take-home" assignments; however, these alternatives are expensive to implement and not scalable.

Hiring a full time employee is expensive. Hiring the wrong people can be disastrous for a company, especially for a startup. Many employers are opting to work with freelancers for cost savings and lower risk. Some of these freelancers could become full-time members of the team. Working with freelancers could also be expensive and risky, especially for a young startup or a non-profit company.

LooseLeaf provides a paradigm-shifting solution for recruiting and freelancing by providing a scalable and sustainable way for you to find and vet potential new members to your team. Specifically:

1. Companies can use LooseLeaf to manage their own communications and projects and have the option to open up their projects for people outside the companies to work on by posting the project on LooseLeaf's project board.
2. Members of your team collaborate with people outside of your company to complete these projects.
3. Members of your team can post their own side projects on LooseLeaf's project board.

The best way to vet potential new members to the team is to have them work with your existing employees. Additionally, projects are a great way for companies to advertise career opportunities.


# FAQ

## Projects -

### What kind of projects are best for LooseLeaf?

In general, projects which have unclear specifications, are low-stake, or have no real need dates are best for LooseLeaf. LooseLeaf is awesome for finding collaborators for priority projects, personal side projects, projects for non-profits, and open source projects.

Some examples of projects you should post on LooseLeaf include:

- A landing page for a non-profit's website
- An original illustration for a blog
- A logo for your open source library

### What kind of people can I expect to find on LooseLeaf to work on my projects?

- People with a full-time job looking for an opportunity to improve their skills
- People in and/or have recently graduated from a career accelerator or vocational training program

### Why should I work on other people's projects for free?

No one should work for others for free but keep in mind that no one will pay you a salary to do a job that you are not yet capable of doing because you lack certain skills and experience. To get those skills and experience, you need to put in the consistent hard-work and follow-through on these projects you elect to contribute to and see them to completion. There's no substitute for hard-work to develop your skills. We believe anyone who is self-motivated to work hard should be able to do so without spending their own money to participate in an educational institution or job training program.

Think of it this way: you are not working for other people when you work on the projects they created. *You are working for yourself and they benefit as a result of you working on your self-improvement.* Their projects offer you an idea and a framework for developing your skills and provide a common ground for you to find others like you and collaborate with them.

Consider working on projects on LooseLeaf an investment in your future, similar to working hard on assignments for a college class.

LooseLeaf does not charge you anything for using the platform to explore your career interests, identify skills gaps, build your portfolio that demonstrates real work experience, receive direction and mentorship from project creators and project collaborators, and cultivate meaningful professional connections. The alternative is quitting your full-time job and spend a ton of your own money to enroll in a college degree, coding bootcamp, a job training program, or hire a career coach. Or you could try self-education and take some free online classes, which can be a lonely experience and may not provide as good of a return-on-investment of your time than working on real projects with other people.

### If they don't get paid to work on my projects, what's in it for them?

You are giving them an interesting and exciting project to work on, which they could add to their portfolio to impress potential employers and paying clients for if they choose to be a freelancer. The chance to work with you and other project collaborators opens up a lot of doors for future career opportunities.

It's free for them to contribute to your project. They own everything they produce and they don't answer to you like an employee would. How much they do and the quality of work they produce is entirely up to them and they can stop contributing anytime they want.

### If I want to pay them for a job well done, how may I do that?
